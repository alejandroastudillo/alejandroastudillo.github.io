By engaging with cutting-edge tools and techniques, participants will develop the skills necessary to navigate complex environments, optimize trajectory paths, and execute tasks with precision and efficiency in robotic systems.\nTo streamline the guided exercises, the workshop makes use of the free and open-source Rockit and Impact software frameworks developed by the MECO Research Team at KU Leuven and built on top of the numerical optimization framework CasADi, designed for efficient nonlinear programming.\nExercises will be mainly in Python, and Docker images containing a development and simulation environment will be provided. Attendees can later adopt the presented open-source software frameworks in their research.\nWhile foundational concepts of OCPs will be introduced, the course focuses on learning-by-doing. The course prioritizes practical know-how, enabling participants to directly apply Rockit and Impact to tackle real-world robotic challenges. The attendees will learn to formulate and solve OCPs, gaining valuable experience in implementing trajectory optimization algorithms and MPC strategies. Moreover, participants will learn how to swiftly deploy OCPs and MPCs in C, Python and ROS 2.\nThis workshop is organized by members of the MECO Research Team of KU Leuven, Belgium. The MECO Research Team focusses on modeling, estimation, identification, analysis and optimal control of motion and motion systems such as mechatronic systems or machine tools. It combines theoretical contributions (development of design methodologies) with experimental knowhow (implementation and experimental validation on lab-scale as well as industrial setups). The theoretical research benefits from the group’s expertise on numerical optimization, especially convex optimization.","tags":[],"title":"Workshop on optimal control problems and model predictive

implementation of robotic applications is currently facing various control challenges that simple controllers fail to address, e.g., systems are increasingly complex, need to comply with constraints and need to account for several, sometimes conflicting performance objectives. Model predictive control (MPC) is an advanced control technique that explicitly accounts for all these challenges by considering system models and solving constrained optimization problems in real-time at every control step. However, wide adoption of MPC in complex robotic applications is impeded by two issues. First, low-level drivers in robotic systems require input updates at high frequency, typically in the order of 1 kHz, which is a control frequency that is difficult to meet for MPC due to its inherent computational complexity. Second, MPC development and deployment is not straightforward and comes with a high engineering cost because proper tools are missing. This work addresses both issues, reducing the computational complexity of MPC implementations for robotic applications and reducing the engineering time required for its deployment. It covers (i) the use of efficient formulations of robot dynamics and their analytical derivatives, (ii) the mixed and transparent use of such analytical derivatives and algorithmic differentiation within an optimization framework, (iii) the efficient evaluation of computationally expensive functions in nonlinear programs by means of task- and data-level parallelization, and (iv) the efficient implementation of numerical optimization algorithms that accelerate the solution of the underlying optimal control problem. Moreover, it consolidates these advances within an easy-to-use, open-source framework that defines a direct workflow from problem definition to robot-based solution deployment. These developments help bridge the gap between advanced optimization-based controllers, like MPC, and complex robotic applications.","tags":[],"title":"Advancing the industrial application of model predictive control for robot manipulators: Improving computational efficiency and facilitating implementation","type":"event"},{"authors":["Alejandro Astudillo"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1684162800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684162800,"objectID":"3bbaff791be1d67f99d1269bde41adc9","permalink":"https://alejandroastudillo.github.io/publication/phd-thesis/","publishdate":"2023-05-25T14:40:14+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/phd-thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"The implementation of robotic applications is currently facing various control challenges that simple controllers fail to address, e.g., systems are increasingly complex, need to comply with constraints and need to account for several, sometimes conflicting performance objectives.

This technique was successfully applied to techniques such as Model Predictive Control and Moving Horizon Estimation, but it can exhibit slow convergence. Moreover, keeping all iterates feasible in FSLP entails a large number of additional constraint evaluations. In this paper, Anderson Acceleration (AA(d)) is applied to the zero-order update strategy improving the convergence rate and therefore decreasing the number of constraint evaluations in the inner iterative procedure of the FSLP algorithm. AA(d) achieves an improved contraction rate in the inner iterations, with proven local linear convergence. In addition, it is observed that due to the improved zero-order update strategy, AA(d)-FSLP takes larger steps to find an optimal solution, yielding faster overall convergence. The performance of AA(d)-FSLP is examined for a time-optimal point-to-point motion problem of a parallel SCARA robot. The reduction of the number of constraint evaluations and overall iterations compared to FSLP is successfully demonstrated.","tags":[],"title":"Anderson Accelerated Feasible Sequential Linear Programming","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shamil Mamedov","Alejandro Astudillo","Daniele Ronzani","Wilm Decré","Jean-Philippe Noël","Jan Swevers"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1675333479,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675333479,"objectID":"620a8bda93cf38e58c6f3816bf8424f4","permalink":"https://alejandroastudillo.github.io/publication/flexible-beam-manipulator/","publishdate":"2022-12-01T11:24:39+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/flexible-beam-manipulator/","section":"publication","summary":"Fast and safe manipulation of flexible objects with a robot manipulator necessitates measures to cope with vibrations. Existing approaches either increase the task execution time or require complex models and/or additional instrumentation to measure vibrations. This paper develops a model-based method that overcomes these limitations.

We experimentally show that the proposed method drastically reduces residual vibrations -- at least 90% -- and outperforms the commonly used input shaping (IS) for the same execution time. Besides, our method can also execute the task faster than IS with a minor reduction in vibration suppression performance.

This allows us to program complex motion tasks by configuring and composing simpler tasks. We provide templates for several basic tasks like point-to-point and end-effector path-following tasks to speed up prototyping. Internally, the task’s symbolic expressions are computed using CasADi and the resulting OCP is transcribed using Rockit. A wide and growing range of mature open-source optimization solvers are supported for solving the OCP. Monitor functions can be easily specified and are automatically deployed with the motion skill, so that the generated motion skills can be easily embedded in a larger control architecture involving higher-level discrete controllers. The motion skills thus programmed can be directly deployed on robot platforms using the C-code generation capabilities of CasADi.

The underlying optimal control problem (OCP) in this scheme can be efficiently solved by using the sequential convex quadratic programming (SCQP) method. Up to now, this scheme has been implemented with constant tunnel radii, although several tasks, such as human-robot collaboration or pick-and-place tasks, would benefit from variable radii throughout task execution. The SCQP method is however not able to exploit the structure of varying-radius tunnel constraints, which can lead to unstable iterations of the SQP method. In this work, we propose a reformulation of the tunnel constraints to overcome this issue, allowing the use of the SCQP method to efficiently solve the underlying OCP. We also provide insight into an efficient implementation of the SCQP method using the lin operator and prove the main theorem underlying such operator.

The use of task parallelism with multicore executions and data parallelism with single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) instructions is shown to effectively reduce the solution time of the underlying OCP so that the satisfaction of real-time constraints in the deployment of MPC for robot manipulators can be achieved.","tags":[],"title":"Speed-Up of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Robot Manipulators Using Task and Data Parallelism","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alejandro Astudillo","Joris Gillis","Moritz Diehl","Wilm Decré","Goele Pipeleers","Jan Swevers"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1642057877,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642057877,"objectID":"39f953e80e15692ea92b0d9f7f046192","permalink":"https://alejandroastudillo.github.io/publication/symbolic-linearization-scqp/","publishdate":"2022-09-12T09:11:17+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/symbolic-linearization-scqp/","section":"publication","summary":"The tunnel-following nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) scheme allows to exploit acceptable deviations around a path reference. This is done by using convex-over-nonlinear functions as objective and constraints in the underlying optimal control problem (OCP). The convex-over-nonlinear structure is exploited by algorithms such as the generalized Gauss-Newton (GGN) method or the sequential convex quadratic programming (SCQP) method to reduce the computational complexity of the OCP solution. However, the modeling effort and engineering time required to implement these methods is high. We address the problem of reducing the modeling effort in the implementation of SCQP, focusing on a standard sequential quadratic programming (SQP) implementation where symbolic linearization is applied to the nonlinear part of the convex-over-nonlinear functions in the objective and constraints. The novelty of this letter is twofold. It introduces a novel operator that applies symbolic linearization in a transparent and easy way to solve nonconvex OCPs with the SCQP method, and introduces a meaningful representation of an orientation-tunnel for robotic applications by means of a convex-over-nonlinear constraint, which preserves the convexity exploitation by the SCQP method. The proposed technique is demonstrated in a tunnel-following task for a 7-degrees-of-freedom manipulator.","tags":[],"title":"Position and Orientation Tunnel-Following NMPC of Robot Manipulators Based on Symbolic Linearization in Sequential Convex Quadratic Programming","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alejandro Astudillo","Justin Carpentier","Joris Gillis","Goele Pipeleers","Jan Swevers"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1635033600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635033600,"objectID":"be13c141c82a3c75c7a0e845382b058b","permalink":"https://alejandroastudillo.github.io/publication/mixed-use-derivatives/","publishdate":"2022-09-12T08:40:52+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/mixed-use-derivatives/","section":"publication","summary":"In the context of nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) for robot manipulators, we address the problem of enabling the mixed and transparent use of algorithmic differentiation (AD) and efficient analytical derivatives of rigid-body dynamics (RBD) to decrease the solution time of the subjacent optimal control problem (OCP).

This system is a tool to perform clinical diagnoses and monitor rehabilitation processes, since it is compact, portable and wireless, allowing gait processes to be measured non-invasively and without altering them. In addition to exposing the physical and logical topologies of the system, this work proposes an algorithmic procedure to align the axes of an inertial sensor with those of a corresponding lower segment, so that the sensor can be arbitrarily located in the segment. Additionally, the system implements a method to calculate the joint angles of flexion / extension (equivalent to the movements of the lower segments in the sagittal plane) and provides an interface that allows the movements of the user to be represented online using a three-dimensional avatar. The system was tested on an ideal joint and on a human knee using a two-dimensional vision system as a means of comparison. When comparing the calculated sagittal angles and the references obtained from the vision system, a mean square error (standard deviation) of 1.65 ° (0.55 °) is obtained for tests on an ideal joint and 1.84 ° (0.48 °) for tests on a human knee, with a correlation of r = 0.99 in both cases.","tags":[],"title":"Silvereye, sistema electrónico para el análisis de la marcha humana en el plano sagital a partir de sensores inerciales","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alejandro Astudillo","Bladimir Bacca","Esteban Rosero"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1508358409,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1508358409,"objectID":"22121d15b91a7cf91f0d87f6e1d272b5","permalink":"https://alejandroastudillo.github.io/publication/smartphone-quadrotor-optimal/","publishdate":"2018-02-01T21:26:49+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/smartphone-quadrotor-optimal/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, a flight control system for a smartphone-based quadrotor is proposed.

The main goal of this research is to stabilize the attitude of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), such as a quadcopter, and control its altitude using exclusively the sensors and processor of a smartphone on-board. As the sensors embedded in the smartphones are not accurate enough to measure the altitude of the quadcopter, a linear Kalman filter for relative altitude estimation was designed and implemented. Here, it is described precisely the hardware that was used to build the test platform, the non-linear an linearized quadcopter model, the software structure to execute the controllers in the smartphone, the sensor fusion algorithms implemented to obtain reliable data from the smartphone sensors, and the cascade PID controllers design. Finally, the success of the proposed system is evidenced in the results of a set of experimental tests. In these tests, the quadcopter attitude was regulated after some disturbances were applied to the system and its altitude was controlled after the reference was changed.","tags":[],"title":"Altitude and attitude cascade controller for a smartphone-based quadcopter","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
