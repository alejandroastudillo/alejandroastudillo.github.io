This is done by using convex-over-nonlinear functions as objective and constraints in the underlying optimal control problem (OCP). The convex-over-nonlinear structure is exploited by algorithms such as the generalized Gauss-Newton (GGN) method or the sequential convex quadratic programming (SCQP) method to reduce the computational complexity of the OCP solution. However, the modeling effort and engineering time required to implement these methods is high. We address the problem of reducing the modeling effort in the implementation of SCQP, focusing on a standard sequential quadratic programming (SQP) implementation where symbolic linearization is applied to the nonlinear part of the convex-over-nonlinear functions in the objective and constraints. The novelty of this letter is twofold. It introduces a novel operator that applies symbolic linearization in a transparent and easy way to solve nonconvex OCPs with the SCQP method, and introduces a meaningful representation of an orientation-tunnel for robotic applications by means of a convex-over-nonlinear constraint, which preserves the convexity exploitation by the SCQP method. The proposed technique is demonstrated in a tunnel-following task for a 7-degrees-of-freedom manipulator.","tags":[],"title":"Position and Orientation Tunnel-Following NMPC of Robot Manipulators Based on Symbolic Linearization in Sequential Convex Quadratic Programming","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alejandro Astudillo","Justin Carpentier","Joris Gillis","Goele Pipeleers","Jan Swevers"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1635033600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635033600,"objectID":"be13c141c82a3c75c7a0e845382b058b","permalink":"https://alejandroastudillo.github.io/publication/mixed-use-derivatives/","publishdate":"2022-09-12T08:40:52+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/mixed-use-derivatives/","section":"publication","summary":"In the context of nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) for robot manipulators, we address the problem of enabling the mixed and transparent use of algorithmic differentiation (AD) and efficient analytical derivatives of rigid-body dynamics (RBD) to decrease the solution time of the subjacent optimal control problem (OCP).

This system is a tool to perform clinical diagnoses and monitor rehabilitation processes, since it is compact, portable and wireless, allowing gait processes to be measured non-invasively and without altering them. In addition to exposing the physical and logical topologies of the system, this work proposes an algorithmic procedure to align the axes of an inertial sensor with those of a corresponding lower segment, so that the sensor can be arbitrarily located in the segment. Additionally, the system implements a method to calculate the joint angles of flexion / extension (equivalent to the movements of the lower segments in the sagittal plane) and provides an interface that allows the movements of the user to be represented online using a three-dimensional avatar. The system was tested on an ideal joint and on a human knee using a two-dimensional vision system as a means of comparison. When comparing the calculated sagittal angles and the references obtained from the vision system, a mean square error (standard deviation) of 1.65 ° (0.55 °) is obtained for tests on an ideal joint and 1.84 ° (0.48 °) for tests on a human knee, with a correlation of r = 0.99 in both cases.","tags":[],"title":"Silvereye, sistema electrónico para el análisis de la marcha humana en el plano sagital a partir de sensores inerciales","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alejandro Astudillo","Bladimir Bacca","Esteban Rosero"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1508358409,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1508358409,"objectID":"22121d15b91a7cf91f0d87f6e1d272b5","permalink":"https://alejandroastudillo.github.io/publication/smartphone-quadrotor-optimal/","publishdate":"2018-02-01T21:26:49+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/smartphone-quadrotor-optimal/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, a flight control system for a smartphone-based quadrotor is proposed.

Due to the shortcomings of smartphones' sensors, a Kalman filter for state estimation is proposed. We also present simulation results of the proposed system using dynamic models and real quadrotor parameters. These results demonstrate the performance advantages of the LQG and controllers.

The main goal of this research is to stabilize the attitude of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), such as a quadcopter, and control its altitude using exclusively the sensors and processor of a smartphone on-board. As the sensors embedded in the smartphones are not accurate enough to measure the altitude of the quadcopter, a linear Kalman filter for relative altitude estimation was designed and implemented. Here, it is described precisely the hardware that was used to build the test platform, the non-linear an linearized quadcopter model, the software structure to execute the controllers in the smartphone, the sensor fusion algorithms implemented to obtain reliable data from the smartphone sensors, and the cascade PID controllers design. Finally, the success of the proposed system is evidenced in the results of a set of experimental tests. In these tests, the quadcopter attitude was regulated after some disturbances were applied to the system and its altitude was controlled after the reference was changed.","tags":[],"title":"Altitude and attitude cascade controller for a smartphone-based quadcopter","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
